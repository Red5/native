# HEVC Support

Placeholder for future support. 

Codec and enums have been added to red5-io version 1.2.4.


## OpenHEVC Decoder

[OpenHEVC](https://github.com/OpenHEVC/openHEVC) project repository (LGPL)

I don't plan to include an HEVC encoder as it would incur the effect of GPL licensing, but I may include stubs for using [x265](http://x265.org/) for those that fork this repo.
